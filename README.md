A minimal-sized Japan-style arcade controller for Sanwa (clone) parts

Lasercut the svg from a 2 mm plexi sheet.

Glue the top plate and all the side panels together using transparent PMMA glue.

Either buy a complete set of buttons, joystick and USB controller board https://amzn.to/2G2kIeg or just get the zero-delay-controller and your pick your own Sanwa or clone devices, you'll need 8 30 mm and 2 24 mm buttons.

Screw the controller into the four holes on the top plate using M2.5 screws, the lasercut spacers and M2.5 mm nuts.

Remove the metal top plate from the joystick and screw it into the joystick holder with the screws that held the top plate.

Insert the buttons into their holes and cable everything up.

Screw the bottom plate to the top plate using long enough M3 screws and glue on rubber feet.
